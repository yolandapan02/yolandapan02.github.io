    <p>This project represents comprehensive strategic analysis for Pechoin, a leading Chinese skincare brand. As team leader for this Oliver Wyman Impact Competition entry, I developed a data-driven expansion strategy identifying Malaysia as the optimal entry point into Southeast Asian markets based on consumer preferences, competitive landscape, and cultural alignment.</p>

    <p>The project addressed critical business challenges through quantitative analysis of beauty industry trends and consumer data. Our strategy integrated a three-pillar brand positioning, tailored product matrix, omni-channel approach, and comprehensive supply chain solution. Financial modeling projected a pathway to $20 million in annual profits by 2030, with planned expansion to Singapore and Indonesia in years 3-5, demonstrating how systematic market analysis creates actionable strategies in competitive markets.</p>
